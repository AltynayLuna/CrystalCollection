A basic interactive number guessing game. There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page. The player is shown a random number at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal. When the player clicks one, the game updates the score counter. The player wins the game if the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game and loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number, all the crystals will have four new hidden values, and the score and score counter will reset to zero. The app also shows the number of games the player wins and loses. Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery.
